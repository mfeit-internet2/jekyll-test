A new bugfix version of perfSONAR, 4.2.2, is now available.  It
contains fixes for various issues discovered by the development team
and community:

 * Updated the default pScheduler limits that ships with the perfSONAR
   Toolkit to use traditional limits instead of a rewrite rule to
   ensure throughput test limits are checked on both ends.

 * Updated provided `python-setuptools` RPM to prevent conflicts with
   version in CentOS when installing packages such as `python2-certbot`.
