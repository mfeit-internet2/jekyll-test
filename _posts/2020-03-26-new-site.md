You may have noticed by now that perfSONAR's web site has a new look.

Most of the content is the same as on the old site, although some of
it has been reorganized.  Redirections from the old locations will be
available for the next year, but please update your bookmarks and
other links.

The documentation continues to live at
[https://docs.perfsonar.net](https://docs.perfsonar.net).  As part of
a future project, it will be merged into this site.

If you find errors or have other problems with the new site, please
don't hesitate to drop us a line at
[perfsonar-training@internet2.edu](perfsonar-training@internet2.edu).

The team would like to thank Internet2 for many years of hosting the
site on its systems.
