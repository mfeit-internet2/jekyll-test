perfSONAR collaboration members are pleased to welcome [Rede Nacional
de Ensino e Pesquisa](https://www.rnp.br/en) (RNP), the national
research and education network of Brazil, as a collaboration
partner.

RNP has been involved with perfSONAR and using perfSONAR tools for 15
years, even having their own implementation of perfSONAR for eight
years.  RNP has adopted perfSONAR 4 as a base, and that version is now
deployed across Brazil in 27 PoPs. Initial specific interests include
containerization, perfSONAR as microservices, standard display and
analysis packages as well as possibly bringing their link testing tool
into the standard perfSONAR package. RNP brings additional effort to
the combined core development team and will play a crucial role in the
continued evolution of perfSONAR.
