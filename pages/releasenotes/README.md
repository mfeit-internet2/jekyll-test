# Adding Release Notes

Edit `index.md` and add the new version number to the top of the list.

Copy one of the existing files into a new file named for the new
version (e.g., `1.2.3b4.md`).  `4.0.2.5.md` is short and makes a good
template.

Edit the new file and change the following:

 * `title` - Adjust the version number
 * `permalink` - Adjust the version number
 * Revise the contents for the new release

Add the new file to Git, commit, push and have a nice day.
