## About the Collaboration

Since its inception in the early 2000s, perfSONAR has been developed
through a collaboration of numerous organizations.


## Development Principles

The perfSONAR collaboration aims to develop, deploy, and promote the
adoption of the perfSONAR software suite in support of federated,
interoperable network performance monitoring across research and
education (R&E) networks around the globe. The collaboration seeks to
grow perfSONAR in both deployment footprint and capabilities to be the
ubiquitous, indispensible performance monitoring framework for R&E
networks.

The collaboration seeks to achieve these aims in a fashion consistent
with the following principles:

 * **Stakeholders.** perfSONAR should be responsive to the needs of
     its stakeholders, defined to include the CIOs of major research
     universities, the CIOs of national research labs (e.g. FNAL,
     CERN), the senior leadership of regional networking organizations
     and national research and education networks (NRENs).

 * **Customers.** perfSONAR should support the implementation and
     operation of networks that support domain scientists in data
     intensive science disciplines (e.g. high energy physics,
     climatology, genetics, etc.), network researchers, and education.

 * **Philosophy.** perfSONAR should be developed via an open,
     transparent, community-driven process that includes formal
     requirements gathering, is responsive to the needs of the major
     stakeholders, and includes direct engagement by the senior
     leadership of organizations contributing resources to the
     development of perfSONAR software.

 * **Implementation.** perfSONAR is an open source project designed to
     develop software that works in a real operational environment, to
     facilitate network research, and to permit technology transfer to
     commercial organizations. The software licensing terms for the
     software are specifically intended to be non-coercive (“all
     carrot, no stick”).

 * **Usability.** perfSONAR is intended to make it easy to set
     appropriate performance expectations, notice performance
     problems, and diagnose the causes of such problems in as
     transparent a fashion as possible. The framework should be easy
     to install, configure, and support for end users, network
     operators, and virtual organizations (scientific collaborations
     including participants from universities around the globe).


## Development Partners

Each development partner contributes at least 1.5 full-time employess
to the project, computing and network resources and meeting space for
developer gatherings.
