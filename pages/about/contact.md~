In order to provide the most accurate and useful measurement results,
the perfSONAR software collects and stores the following data about a
perfSONAR node and the organization it belongs to:

 * Organization name and domain name

 * perfSONAR node location (site name, city, region, country and
   geographic coordinates)

 * Host details such as hardware specifications and characteristics of
   network interfaces including IP addresses and MAC addresses

 * perfSONAR software-specific parameters such as version numbers and
   supported features

The e-mail address of a maintainer is also requested and may
optionally be provided by the user. Since this e-mail address should
be used only for communication related to the operations of the
specific node, it is highly recommended that a role or group e-mail
address is used instead of a personal one. Any personal data entered
would be of the user's own responsibility and will by no means
represent an obligation for the perfSONAR project.

Gathered data is stored in databases running on multiple distributed
servers around the world referred to as the Lookup Service (LS) and
operated by different partner organizations. Additional servers could
be added in the future for redundancy and scalability reasons. Data is
also replicated on some other services such as the Lookup Service
caches. All data published is publicly available and may be copied by
third-party services or reporting tools, this includes email address
or names optionally entered into the registration by the user. Please
keep the public nature of this data in mind when choosing to provide
information.

Data is kept in the Lookup Service and cache servers for no more than
24 hours without a renewal message from the user's perfSONAR node. A
user can delete an entry at any time by removing the target
information from their server or sending an explicit delete message to
the Lookup Service. Data may be archived for a longer period of time
by reporting servers such at those operated by ESnet (US) and GÃ‰ANT
(PL/DE), but the data is not kept for more than six months in those
known cases.

If you have any queries about the data stored or process by perfSONAR,
please [contact us](about_contact.html).
