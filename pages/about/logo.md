## Usage Guidelines

{% include important.html content="Please note the terms of the [license](#license) for this image prohibit any distribution of modified versions of the perfSONAR logo.   The license does not force compliance with the usage guidelines, but doing so is requested to present perfSONAR in a positive light.<br/><br/>If you have an application for which an existing version of the logo is unsuitable, please [contact the development team](about_contact.html)." %}

 * Where possible, use the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) version for
   the best rendering.  SVG is supported by almost all modern desktop
   and mobile browsers.

 * If using a PNG, please select one that is larger than your intended
   rendering size so it can be scaled down rather than up.

 * The image contains empty space around the edges which should be
   preserved.

The perfSONAR project allows for redistribution of the perfSONAR logo
to represent perfSONAR elements in network diagrams and other
presentations as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole,
with credit to the perfSONAR product.

### File Names

The Tar and Zip contain numerous files with various renderings of the
logo, each named in one of these formats:

 * `perfsonar-TYPE-COLOR-FILL.svg` - [Scalable Vector
   Graphics](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2) with all text converted to
   paths so fonts are not required.

 * `perfsonar-TYPE-COLOR-FILL-HEIGHT.png` - [Portable Network
   Graphics](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png) with a transparent
   background in various heights.

`TYPE`, `COLOR`, `FILL` and `HEIGHT` are described in the sections
below.


#### Type

 * `logo` - The crosshairs with surrounding _perfSONAR_ text.  Use
   this version to refer to perfSONAR the product.

 * `powered` - The standard logo with "powered" underneath.  Use this
   version on hardware devices running perfSONAR or software that has
   perfSONAR embedded.

 * `icon` - The crosshairs only.  Use this version as a symbol for
   perfSONAR nodes on network diagrams or as bullets in perfSONAR
   marketing material.

#### Color

The color refers to the color of the crosshairs and text, if the
latter is present.  This will be `black` or `white`.


#### Fill

 * `empty` - The area inside the crosshairs is not filled.

 * `full` - The area inside the crosshairs is filled in the RGB color
   `#31b63f` at 100% opacity.

 * `transparent` - Like `full`, but with the opacity of the fill at
   75%.


#### Height

For PNG images, this is the height in pixels.
