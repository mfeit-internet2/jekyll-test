## Usage Guidelines

{% include important.html content="Please note the terms of the [license](#license) for this image prohibit any distribution of modified versions of the perfSONAR logo.   The license does not force compliance with the usage guidelines, but doing so is requested to present perfSONAR in a positive light.<br/><br/>If you have an application for which an existing version of the logo is unsuitable, please [contact the development team](about_contact.html)." %}

 * Where possible, use the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) version for
   the best rendering.  SVG is supported by almost all modern desktop
   and mobile browsers.

 * If using a PNG, please select one that is larger than your intended
   rendering size so it can be scaled down rather than up.

 * The image contains empty space around the edges which should be
   preserved.
