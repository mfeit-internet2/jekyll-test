## About the Collaboration

Since its inception in the early 2000s, perfSONAR has been developed
through a collaboration of numerous organizations.  In 2014, a
development partnership was established to further the development of
perfSONAR.  The participants in this partnership are:

{% assign logo_height = 48.0 %}
{% assign partner_length = page.local.partner | size %}
{% assign partner_percent = 1.0 | divided_by: partner_length | times: 100.0 %}

{% include todo.html content="This table needs to be cleaned up." %}
<table align="center" width="100%">
  <tr>
{% for partner in page.local.partner %}
    <td width="{{ partner_percent }}%" style="align:center; vertical-align:bottom;">
      <center><a href="{{ partner.url }}" target="_blank"><img src="{{ partner.logo }}" alt="{{ partner.name }}" style="height: {{ logo_height | times: partner.scale }}pt;" /></a><br/>{{ partner.year }}</center>
    </td>
{% endfor %}
  </tr>
</table>

Each development partner contributes the following:

 * A minimum of 1.5 full-time employees
 * Computing and network resources
 * Meeting space for developer gatherings

If your organization is interested in becoming a perfSONAR development
partner, please contact us at
[perfsonar-lead@internet2.edu](mailto:perfsonar-lead@internet2.edu).



## Contributing Organizations

The success of perfSONAR depends on contributions from the community
in the form of development contributions, software testing, feature
suggestions, and deployment.  The development team would like to thank
the following organizations for contributions to perfSONAR:

{% include todo.html content="Make sure all of these links are good." %}

{% for contrib in page.local.contrib %}
 * [{{ contrib.name }}]({{ contrib.url }}){% if contrib.nick %} ({{ contrib.nick }}){% endif %}
