The perfSONAR collaboration uses feedback from a number of sources to
determine our roadmap for future releases.

These sources include the following:

 * Requests on the [project issue
   tracker](https://github.com/perfsonar/project/issues)

 * Annual user surveys sent to everyone on the [user
   list](mailto:perfsonar-user@internet2.edu)

 * Regular meetings with virtual organizations using perfSONAR such as
   the [WLCG](http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/) and
   [OSG](http://www.opensciencegrid.org/)

 * Regular meetings of the [NTAC performance working
   group](https://wiki.internet2.edu/confluence/display/ntac/Performance+Working+Group+Charter)

 * Discussions at various perfSONAR related workshops, such as
   [OIN](http://oinworkshop.com/),
   [FTW](https://meetings.internet2.edu/2015-ftw-perfsonar-deployment-best-practices/),
   and other similarly-sponsored meetings.

 * Discussions with various funding sponsors

Based on feedback and requests from all of the above, every 6-12
months the perfSONAR governance group meets to recommend and
prioritize features based on:

 * Impact to the community
 * Level of effort required to implement and support
 * Availability of someone with the right skill set for the task

During the requirements gathering activities we will solicit
contributors to join an e-mail list that will be used to disseminate a
candidate roadmap to the community for feedback.  This roadmap will
then be refined based on this feedback to meet the communityâ€™s needs.
