## The Partners

Since 2014, the bulk of development work on pefSONAR has been funded
and carried out by a [development partnership](collab_about.html).
Each of the partners has a vested interest in the success of perfSONAR,
either because they use it in running their own networks, represent
members who do or service organizations who use it.

The existence of the partnership has provided a stable base for
perfSONAR and served as a reliable source for enhancements, bug fixes
and security patches.


## The Community

Being an [open-source](about_license.html) project, perfSONAR's users
are welcome to make modifications to suit their needs, and the project
welcomes contributions that are of general interest to the user base.
[Dozens of
organizations](collab_about.html#contributing-organizations) and
individuals have contributed code and insight to perfSONAR.
